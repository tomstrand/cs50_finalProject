CS50 Final Project

This is my final project in cs50 introduction to computer science on edx.org

The purpose of this project is to showcase what have been learned throughout the course. 

While it is not a requirement to use excactly the same languages and frameworks as tought in the course, the prosject shall build upon the same principals.

will buld something that interests me and at the same time showcases possible usage in the industrial automation sector where I have been working for the last 10+ years.
